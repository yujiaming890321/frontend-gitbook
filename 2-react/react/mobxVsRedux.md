# mobx vs redux

dependency graphs vs immutable state trees

mobx:
easy to update.
there is a graph structure: nodes can refer to each other.
action is simpler and co-located with data.
reference by identity

redux:
some consistency instead of rule of deterministic ways of doing things
easily testable.
