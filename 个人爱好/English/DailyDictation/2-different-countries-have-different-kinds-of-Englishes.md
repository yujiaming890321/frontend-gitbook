# Different Countries Have Different Kinds of Englishes

Voyages of people from English play an important part in spreading the English language.
At present, English is frequently spoken as an official or common language in many contries, such as America, Singapore, Malaysia and some African contries.
All based on British English, the English spoken in these countries can be well understood by native English speakers.
But actually, these Englishes have been gradually changing in accents, spellings, expressions and the usage of vocabulary.
Because of this fact, you can make use of the differences to tell which country the foreigners of your block are from.
For example, if a boss fluently commands his driver,"Come up straight to my apartment by elevator and take some gas for my trucks and cabs", instead of requesting, "Please come to my flat by lift and take some petrol for my lorries and taxis", you can recognize his American identity, while the latter suggests that he is British.
